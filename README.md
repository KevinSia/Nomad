#Nomad

## Getting started
- Make a folder with a name of your choice
- `cd` into your folder
- clone source files from github -> `git clone https://github.com/KevinSia/Nomad`
- Done!

## Develop!
- Always make a new branch before starting to work on a new feature 
  - Example: working a form
    - Make sure you're making a new branch *from master branch* -> `git branch`
    - Create a new branch -> `git checkout -b <type>/<description>`
      - Eg: `git checkout -b user/sign_in`
